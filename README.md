## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Node.js (v14+ or your target version)  
- npm or yarn  
- A SQL database server (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL)  
- Git  

### Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yasas2000/Level-2-project-ChildishThings.git
   cd Level-2-project-ChildishThings
   ```

2. Set up the database  
   - Create a new database  
   - Run the migration / SQL scripts from `DB‑L2Childish` folder  

3. Backend setup  
   ```bash
   cd BackEnd‑L2Childish
   npm install
   ```
   - Create a `.env` file (or config) with database credentials, port, other secrets  
   - Example `.env`:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=myuser
     DB_PASS=mypassword
     DB_NAME=childishthings
     PORT=5000
     ```

4. Frontend setup  
   ```bash
   cd ../FrontEnd‑L2ChildishThings
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

1. Start backend server  
   ```bash
   cd BackEnd‑L2Childish
   npm run start    # or `npm run dev` if using nodemon / hot reload
   ```

2. Start frontend  
   ```bash
   cd ../FrontEnd‑L2ChildishThings
   npm run start
   ```

3. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port the frontend is using)

## API Endpoints

Below is an example of core API endpoints (adjust based on your implementation):

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/items` | Get list of all childish things |
| GET | `/api/items/:id` | Get a single item by ID |
| POST | `/api/items` | Create a new item |
| PUT | `/api/items/:id` | Update an existing item |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id` | Delete an item |

If you have authentication routes:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Login and receive token |

## Future Improvements

- Add user roles / permissions  
- Better validation & error handling  
- Pagination & filtering for listing items  
- Search functionality  
- Enhanced UI / UX / styling  
- Unit tests / integration tests  
- Continuous Integration / Deployment
